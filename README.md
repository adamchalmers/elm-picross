# elm-picross
Picross game in Elm

**Instructions**
 - Click a square/cell to cycle between neutral, filled in, and empty.
 - Game will tell you if you get the layout correct.

**TODO**
 - Make column/row headers coloured depending on whether you've completed or messed up a block
 - Level import/export via copy-pasted codes
  - Use some very simple obfuscation so the level code doesn't spoil the layout.
 - Level maker GUI which generates the level code for sharing.
 - Nicer UI
